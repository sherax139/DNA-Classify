# DNA-Classify
DNA Analysis with Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)

In this endeavor, we'll explore bioinformatics using Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) techniques. Our attention will be on a dataset containing 100 DNA sequences, each consisting of 57 consecutive nucleotides. Our objective is to import this data, transform it into numerical form, and subsequently, train different classification algorithms. The goal is to analyze and differentiate various machine learning algorithms' performance in classifying genomic data.
